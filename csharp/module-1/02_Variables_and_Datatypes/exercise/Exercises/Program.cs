            51. Bill and Jill are house painters. Bill can paint a standard room in 2.15 hours, while Jill averages
            1.90 hours. How long will it take the two painters working together to paint 5 standard rooms?
            Hint: Calculate the rate at which each painter can complete a room (rooms / hour), combine those rates,
            and then divide the total number of rooms to be painted by the combined rate.
