public string ReverseString(string str)
{
    for(int str.Length - 1; i < str.Length; i++)
    {
        if
    }
}
for loop with i++, add them backwards, 
loop through backwards, i--, set the new string to location in the array that you are at at the end of your new string. if youre at length - 1 index, loop through and put it onto a new string.
