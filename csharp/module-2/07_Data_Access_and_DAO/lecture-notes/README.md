# Database Connectivity (DAO)

## Problem statement

A common requirement for most of the applications that people use is that they need to maintain a "persistent state." This means that certain interactions with the application have lasting effects that can be recalled hours, days, or weeks later.

- Order history at Amazon.com
- LinkedIn profile information
- Email messages in GMail

This data often needs to be retrieved and updated in order for the application to fulfill its purpose. One of the most common ways an application stores persistent data is by using a database.

## Overview of session

The students have already seen how they can interact with a database directly by typing SQL commands into a GUI client like SQL Server Management Studio. Today they'll learn how to write application code that can interact with a database in order to read and write persistent data.

## Session objectives

* Understand how to create database connections
* Understand how to execute SQL statements and use parameters
* Introduce the DAO pattern
